            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
                In the early 1990s, a small group of forward-thinking entrepreneurs recognized the growing need 
                for efficient business management systems within the manufacturing and distribution industries. 
                They began as a modest consultancy, providing businesses with tailored advice on improving operational 
                efficiency. As technology advanced, they saw an opportunity to develop their own integrated software 
                solutions, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional business operations and the emerging digital age.</p>                
                
                Driven by their passion for innovation and customer-centric values, this group of visionaries launched Carriage 
                Commercial Systems in 1995, naming the company after their first client: a family-owned carriage manufacturing 
                business that thrived with the help of their system. What started as a solution for one business soon grew into 
                a comprehensive platform, offering solutions to companies across industries. Today, Carriage Commercial Systems 
                stands as a global leader in business management technology, continuing the legacy of helping businesses succeed 
                on their own terms.
